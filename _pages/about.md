<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D. student at the Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies, School of Computer Science, Peking University, under the supervision of <a href='https://cs.pku.edu.cn/info/1091/1657.htm'>Prof. Jun Gao</a>. Prior to now, I obtained my B.Eng. degree from the College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Tongji University, under the supervision of <a href='http://cs1.tongji.edu.cn/~dawei/'>Prof. Dawei Cheng</a>. My research interest includes AI+DB and Graph Learning.
